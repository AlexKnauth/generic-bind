- none of my optimizations in ~for/common seems to have sped things up:
  - eliminate checks for #:when #t
  - dont call final unless needed (ie dont just call an id default)
  - dont call break? unless specified (ie no (lambda _ #f) default)
  - remove spurious call-with-values when there is only 1 accum

common errors and their causes:

** Error: "expected a generic bind instance in: ( ... )"
** Probable cause: 
 Not properly splicing a syntax-splicing-class pattern variable.

** Error: "no #%app transformer" (or other weird errors)
** Probable cause:
 Bad local-expand and you're not catcing the error properly.
